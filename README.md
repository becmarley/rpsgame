# rpsgame
I created a function that randomly chooses an element from an array and assigns that element to a variable.
I created a function that adds points to either the computer or player depending on which element was selected for each and displays each after a round.
  I concatenated variables in order to make it more simple for me when creating return responses.
I created another function that used a while loop to automatically replay until the computer or player reaches a certain number.
  I used if-else statements to return a message that tells the player how to play again if they want to.
